# Side Hustle Finder

## Overview
Helps users discover quick side hustle opportunities via mobile apps and platforms. Matches individual skills, availability, and income goals to gig economy options across delivery, rideshare, freelancing, task-based, and micro-task platforms.

## When to Use
- A user wants to find side income opportunities matching their skills
- Exploring gig economy apps (Uber, DoorDash, Instacart, TaskRabbit, etc.)
- Comparing pay rates, flexibility, and requirements across platforms
- Finding remote freelance or micro-task work (Upwork, Fiverr, MTurk, etc.)
- Evaluating which side hustles fit a specific schedule or income goal
- Researching startup costs, equipment needs, or background check requirements

## How It Works
Profiles the user's skills, location, availability, and income targets. Cross-references against a curated database of gig platforms, categorizing opportunities by type (driving, delivery, tasks, freelance, micro-tasks, rentals, etc.).

## Steps
1. Profile the user: skills, location, schedule, income goal, vehicle access
2. Categorize matching platforms by type and effort level
3. For each match, provide: pay estimate, flexibility, requirements, signup process
4. Prioritize top 3–5 opportunities with expected earnings and time commitment
5. Provide tips for maximizing earnings: peak times, stacking apps, referral bonuses
6. Flag any red flags: scams, high fees, unrealistic earning claims

## Common Pitfalls
- Overestimating earnings — provide realistic ranges, not best-case scenarios
- Ignoring expenses (gas, wear, self-employment tax, platform fees)
- Recommending platforms not available in the user's region
- Failing to mention background check delays or vehicle requirements
- Suggesting too many options — focus on highest-ROI matches first

## Inputs

- `profile` -- skills, location, schedule/availability, income goal, vehicle access
- `platform_scope` -- gig categories to consider: driving, delivery, tasks, freelance, micro-tasks, rentals

## Outputs

- Categorized platform matches, each with: pay estimate (realistic range, not best-case), flexibility, requirements, and signup process
- Top 3-5 prioritized opportunities with expected earnings and time commitment
- Earning-maximization tips (peak times, stacking apps, referral bonuses) and red flags (scams, high fees, unrealistic claims)

## Example

A car owner with evenings free and a $500/mo goal: DoorDash + Instacart stacked during peak dinner hours plus referral bonuses -- realistic $450-600/mo after gas and platform fees, with the background-check wait time flagged upfront.

## Errors & edge cases

- **Overestimating earnings** -- provide realistic ranges, never best-case scenarios.
- **Ignoring expenses** -- gas, wear, self-employment tax, and platform fees change the math; include them.
- **Region-unavailable platforms** -- verify availability in the user's region before recommending.
- **Hidden gating** -- mention background-check delays and vehicle requirements upfront.
- **Too many options** -- suggest the highest-ROI matches first; a long list is not a plan.
