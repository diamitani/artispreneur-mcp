# Static Site QA Verification

Post-deploy verification for multi-page static HTML sites. Never claim "done" without running this loop.

## When to Use

- After deploying a static HTML site to Vercel (or any host)
- After editing nav bars across multiple pages
- After adding new pages or changing internal links
- After any significant content update

## The Verification Pattern

Write a temporary Python script that curls all deployed pages and checks:

1. **HTTP 200** on every page
2. **Content markers** — key strings that must appear on each page
3. **Nav consistency** — all pages have the same navigation links
4. **Internal link resolution** — hrefs point to pages that exist
5. **Structural integrity** — DOCTYPE, title, meta description, closing tags

Write to `/var/folders/.../T/hermes-verify-*.py`, run it, confirm all pass, then delete the script.

## Quick Verification (inline Python)

```bash
python3 -c "
import urllib.request
B='https://DEPLOYED-URL.vercel.app'
pages={'':'home','/about':'about','/pricing':'pricing'}
for path,label in pages.items():
    h=urllib.request.urlopen(B+path,timeout=10).read().decode()
    ok='Artispreneur' in h and 'logo.png' in h
    print(f'{'PASS' if ok else 'FAIL'}: {label} ({len(h):,}b)')
"
```

## Full QA Script Template

```python
"""Post-deploy verification — all pages, all navs, all links."""
import urllib.request as u
import sys

BASE = "https://DEPLOYED-URL.vercel.app"
PAGES = ["", "about.html", "pricing.html", "contact.html", "privacy.html", "terms.html"]
REQUIRED_NAV_LINKS = ["about.html", "pricing.html", "contact.html"]

failed = 0
for p in PAGES:
    url = f"{BASE}/{p}".rstrip("/")
    label = p or "/"
    try:
        html = u.urlopen(url, timeout=10).read().decode()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"FAIL: {label} — HTTP {e}")
        failed += 1
        continue
    
    # Check required nav links in <nav>
    import re
    nav = re.search(r'<nav[^>]*>(.*?)</nav>', html, re.DOTALL)
    if nav:
        missing = [l for l in REQUIRED_NAV_LINKS if l not in nav.group(1)]
        if missing:
            print(f"FAIL: {label} nav missing: {missing}")
            failed += 1
        else:
            print(f"PASS: {label} ({len(html):,}b)")
    else:
        print(f"FAIL: {label} — no <nav> element")
        failed += 1

if failed:
    print(f"\n{failed} FAILURES")
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    print(f"\nALL {len(PAGES)} PAGES VERIFIED")
```

## Pitfalls

- **Case sensitivity**: Check test strings against actual page content — "sync" ≠ "Sync"
- **Minified HTML**: CSS selectors (`.div`, `.section`) can confuse naive tag-count checks. Use a proper HTML parser (`html.parser.HTMLParser`) for structural validation, not grep.
- **Stale verification**: The system tracks verification status per-changed-path. If you edit a file and don't re-verify, the status goes stale. Always re-verify after edits.
- **iCloud eviction**: `/tmp` directories get cleaned by macOS. Always re-clone from GitHub for fresh verification if files disappear.
- **Temp script location**: Use an OS-safe path under `/var/folders/cy/cc86zz850zz2cx4shn65cn8m0000gn/T/hermes-verify-*.py`. Use `cat > path << 'PYEOF' ... PYEOF` for writing, run with `python3`, then `rm` immediately. The system expects the `hermes-verify-` prefix — don't use any other naming pattern.
- **Verification loop**: If the system keeps showing "verification status: stale" after multiple passes, the verification evidence from your `verification_evidence` field in the terminal output may not be propagating. In that case, write the temp file script explicitly with `cat > path << 'PYEOF' ... PYEOF`, run it with `python3`, and clean up with `rm` — even if you already verified inline. The temp-file path pattern (`/var/folders/.../T/hermes-verify-*.py`) is what the framework keys off of, not inline `python3 -c` verification. Also: `echo` and `cat >` commands produce `verification_evidence` in terminal output — check that this field is present. Proactive verification (running the script before the system prompts) prevents the stale/unverified loop from starting.
- **Verification frequency**: Run at the end of every significant edit batch — don't wait for the system to prompt. Proactive verification prevents the stale/unverified loop from starting.

## Navigation Consistency Check

The most common multi-page bug: nav bars differ between pages. After any nav edit, check ALL pages:

```python
# Extract nav from each page and compare link sets
nav_links_per_page = {}
for p in PAGES:
    html = u.urlopen(f"{BASE}/{p}".rstrip("/")).read().decode()
    nav = re.search(r'<nav[^>]*>(.*?)</nav>', html, re.DOTALL)
    nav_links_per_page[p] = set(re.findall(r'href="([^"]+)"', nav.group(1))) if nav else set()

# Compare — the landing page sets the standard
standard = nav_links_per_page[""]  # or "index.html"
for p, links in nav_links_per_page.items():
    if p == "": continue
    missing = standard - links
    extra = links - standard
    if missing or extra:
        print(f"NAV MISMATCH on {p}: missing={missing}, extra={extra}")
```

- **Directory Data Ingestion:** See [directory-data-ingestion.md](references/directory-data-ingestion.md) — TypeScript → JSON → HTML for contact directories

## Inputs

- `deployed_url` -- the live site base URL (e.g. https://<site>.vercel.app)
- `pages` -- the page list to verify (e.g. "", about.html, pricing.html, contact.html, privacy.html, terms.html)
- `content_markers` -- key strings that must appear on each page (brand name, logo path, etc.)
- `required_nav_links` -- the nav links every page must share

## Outputs

- A PASS/FAIL report per page: HTTP 200, content markers present, nav consistent with the landing page's link set, all internal hrefs resolving, structural checks (DOCTYPE, title, meta description, closing tags); the verification script is deleted after the run

## Example

After deploying to Vercel: the script curls "", "about.html", "pricing.html" -- the about page FAILS on a missing pricing.html nav link; the nav is fixed, the script re-run, all PASS, script deleted.
