**Important:** This skill provides educational guidance only. It does not constitute professional tax or legal advice. Users should consult a qualified tax professional for their specific situation.

## When to Use

- Preparing annual personal tax returns (1040) — deductions, credits, filing status
- Understanding business tax obligations: sole proprietorship, LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp
- Evaluating ERC (Employee Retention Credit) eligibility for businesses affected by COVID-19
- Completing IRS Form 7202 for self-employed sick and family leave credits
- Tax planning throughout the year: estimated payments, retirement contributions, entity structure
- Responding to IRS notices and understanding audit risks
- Planning for major life events with tax implications: marriage, home purchase, business start, inheritance
- Understanding deductible business expenses and record-keeping requirements

## How It Works

Describe your tax situation (personal, business, or both) and the specific area you need help with. The skill walks through relevant forms, deductions, credits, and deadlines. For complex scenarios, it provides structured guidance to organize your information before meeting with a tax professional.

## Steps

### 1. Personal Tax Preparation

- Gather documents: W-2s, 1099s, mortgage interest (1098), student loan interest, investment statements, charitable donation receipts
- Determine filing status and dependency considerations
- Identify applicable deductions: standard vs. itemized (mortgage interest, state/local taxes, charitable, medical)
- Review tax credits: Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, education credits (AOTC, LLC), energy credits
- Calculate estimated payments and check for underpayment penalties

### 2. Business Tax Guidance

- Entity selection implications: sole prop (Schedule C), LLC, S-Corp (1120S), C-Corp (1120)
- Business deductions: home office, vehicle/mileage, equipment (Section 179), health insurance, retirement contributions
- Payroll taxes: W-2 employees vs. 1099 contractors, self-employment tax
- Quarterly estimated tax calculations and payment deadlines
- State and local business tax obligations

### 3. ERC (Employee Retention Credit) Assistance

- Determine eligibility periods (2020 Q2-Q4, 2021 Q1-Q3 for most businesses)
- Qualification tests: government shutdown impact OR gross receipts decline
- Calculate qualified wages and credit amounts (50% for 2020, 70% for 2021)
- Required documentation: payroll records, shutdown orders, revenue comparisons
- Filing: amended payroll tax returns (Form 941-X)
- Warning: be aware of ERC scams and aggressive promoters — consult a reputable tax professional

### 4. IRS Form 7202 Guidance

- Eligibility: self-employed individuals who missed work due to COVID-19 illness, quarantine, caregiving, or vaccine recovery (April 2021 – September 2021)
- Calculate credits: sick leave equivalent (up to 10 days) and family leave equivalent (up to 50 days)
- Determine daily credit amount based on net earnings from self-employment
- Integration with Form 1040 Schedule 3 (Additional Credits and Payments)
- Required documentation: dates unable to work, reason, daily net earnings calculation

### 5. Tax Planning & Optimization

- Retirement contributions: 401(k), SEP IRA, Solo 401(k), IRA limits and deadlines
- Health Savings Account (HSA) contributions and qualified medical expenses
- Tax-loss harvesting for investment accounts
- Charitable giving strategies: donor-advised funds, qualified charitable distributions from IRAs
- Timing income and deductions across tax years

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing estimated tax payments** — Self-employed and business owners must pay quarterly. Penalties apply even if you ultimately get a refund.
2. **Poor record-keeping** — Deductions without receipts won't survive an audit. Use apps or spreadsheets to track expenses year-round.
3. **DIY on complex returns** — If you have a business, investments, rental property, or foreign accounts, a tax professional can save you more than their fee.
4. **Ignoring IRS notices** — Respond promptly. Most IRS problems get worse (and more expensive) when ignored.
5. **Relying on ERC mills** — Many ERC promoters use aggressive eligibility claims. The IRS has flagged ERC as a high-fraud area. Verify eligibility independently.

## Inputs

- `tax_situation` -- personal, business, or both; the specific area: annual return, business obligations, ERC evaluation, Form 7202, year-round planning, IRS notices, or life-event planning
- `documents` -- W-2s, 1099s, 1098s, investment statements, donation receipts, payroll records, shutdown orders, revenue comparisons (as applicable)

## Outputs

- Step-by-step guidance for the area: personal (filing status, standard vs. itemized, credits), business (entity implications, deductions, payroll vs. contractor, quarterly estimates), ERC (eligibility periods 2020Q2-2021Q3, 50%/70% credit math, 941-X filing), Form 7202 (sick/family leave day counts, daily credit from net self-employment earnings, Schedule 3 integration), and planning (retirement, HSA, loss harvesting, charitable strategies, income timing)

## Example

A self-employed consultant: gather 1099s -> evaluate Form 7202 (missed 8 days to COVID quarantine, April 2021) -> compute daily credit from net self-employment earnings -> integrate via Schedule 3 -> set up quarterly estimated payments to avoid underpayment penalties.

## Errors & edge cases

- **Missing estimated tax payments** -- quarterly payments are required; penalties apply even with an eventual refund.
- **Poor record-keeping** -- deductions without receipts won't survive an audit; track expenses year-round.
- **DIY on complex returns** -- business + investments + rentals + foreign accounts: a professional usually pays for themselves.
- **Ignoring IRS notices** -- respond promptly; ignored problems get worse and more expensive.
- **ERC mills** -- aggressive promoters, high-fraud area; verify eligibility independently and consult a reputable professional.
- **Not professional advice** -- this skill is educational only; complex scenarios get organized here, then go to a qualified tax professional.
